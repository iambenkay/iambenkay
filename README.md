# BENKAY
### Senior Software Engineer & Maker
I specialize in optimizing software systems and helping businesses scale their technology efficiently. With a focus on performance improvement, software design, and architecture, I work closely with teams to implement smart, sustainable solutions.

From startups to established companies, Iâ€™m passionate about solving complex problems, streamlining processes, and driving innovation in the tech space. Letâ€™s connect to discuss how we can transform your software for growth and success.

### I am working on...
1. [WasmLang](https://github.com/iambenkay/wasmlang) - a type-safe programming language that compiles to WebAssembly.
2. [MLC Flutter](https://github.com/iambenkay/mlc_flutter) - a flutter wrapper for mlcswift. Allows you to interact with an on-device LLM from a flutter app. Not cross-platform yet.
3. [Sixelf](https://sixelf.com) - a contribution tracking tool for designers. Imports contributions from Figma and creates a heatmap out of it. Automatically updates regularly.
